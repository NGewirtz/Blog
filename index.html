favorite quotes

"Since large programs grow from small ones, it is crucial that we develop an arsenal of standard program structures of whose correctness we have become sure -- we call them idioms -- and learn to combine them into larger structures using organizational techniques of proven value."

One of the fundamental building blocks of coding is breaking code into fundamental building blocks. This reminds me that I want to focus on making sure my functions are short, to the point, and address just a single problem.


"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures."

Maybe obvious but I havent thought about this explicitly before. The main data types of high level languages
like arrays and hashes allow us to learn about just a few data structures which can be used to solve
many problems with now standard built in methods. This is the insight I am hoping to gain from going back and reading classic computer science books, learning more about what I take for granted in development, and that it was not always this way.
