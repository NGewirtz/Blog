My personal playground to experiment with new (at least to me)
technologies such as GraphQL, and CSS Grid, as well as keep track of
my daily progress related to strengthening my JavaScript, and
software engineering skills.

## Goal

I want to create both a notebook to track and reinforce the concepts Im learning,
as well as an interactive representation of these new concepts, ideas, and technologies in practice.

## Technology

React/Redux frontend, responsive CSS Grid, with node.js backend api, connected with GraphQL and D3.js for data visualization.

## Features

Calendar view of daily progress reports

Long term tracking of hours spent in each area of focus
